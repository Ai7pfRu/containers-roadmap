# Experimental Public Roadmap - AWS Container Services
---

## Introduction
This is the experimental public roadmap for AWS Container services.
Our customers are asking us for more information about our upcoming products and
priorities, and we want to create a mechanism for not only delivering that information but
getting feedback.

# FAQ
**Q: Why did you build this?**

A: We know that our customers are making decisions and plans based on what we are developing, and we want to provide our customers the insights they need to plan.

**Q: Why are there no dates on your roadmap?**

A: Because job zero is security and operational stability, we can't provide specific
target dates for features.

**Q: What do the roadmap categories mean?**
* *Just shipped* - obvious, right?
* *Coming soon* - coming up.  Think 3-6 months, give or take.
* *We're working on it* - in progress, but further out.  We might still be working through the implementation details, or scoping stuff out.

**Q: Is everything on the roadmap?**

A: The majority of our development work for Amazon EKS and other AWS-sponsored OSS projects are included on this roadmap. Of course, there will be technologies we are very excited about that we are going to launch without notice to surprise and delight our customers.

**Q: How can I provide feedback or ask for more information?**

A: Please open an issue!

**Q: Will you accept a pull request?**

A: We haven't worked out out pull requests should work for a public roadmap page, but we will take all PRs very seriously and review for inclusion.
